Code for Debian Sid/sidux, Debian Testing, and Debian Stable maintenance. Includes the code for smxi, the system maintenance script.

As time permits,  [script documentation](http://techpatterns.com/docs) will be added and updated, check there now and then to see how the documentation is developing.
You can also just go to the project [home page](http://techpatterns.com/forums/about736.html), although it's usually not up to date.

For latest script options, always check with the -h option, which lists all supported options for users.

These change now and then, so make sure you know all the possible choices.

## sgfxi and svmi are now sited at their own svns ##
sgfxi and svmi are made for Debian Sid/Testing, and mostly work in Stable as well, and should work fine as stand alone scripts in all cases. They also have more options when run alone than when fired by smxi, so check them out to see if there's something in them that might be of use to you.

sgfxi now has its [own svn](http://code.google.com/p/sgfxi) because it needs to become more of a standalone project, like the new [inxi irc/system information script](http://code.google.com/p/inxi)

svmi, a script to install and maintain some virtualbox and vmware components on your debian system, also has its own [own svn](http://code.google.com/p/svmi) because it needs to become more of a standalone project.

Have fun.
